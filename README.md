Active Directory was setup with 1000+ users with a powershell script drawing in names from a text file.
A scope of IP's was created from 172.16.0.100 - 200.
After this I domain joined the PC named as CLIENT1 which I had previously installed.
Using Nessus Essentials I scanned the PC, remediated the Vulnerabilites and created a report for my findings.
