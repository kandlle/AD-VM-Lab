# Help Desk Lab
<br>
While I had the environment configured I was curios about how the IT department uses it to complete common tasks so I started exploring just that.
<br>
Things I learned:
<br>
Reset a password for a user on next logon in users and computers.
<br>
Install software on next boot by creating a shared network folder and Group Policy Object applicable to the computers specified.
<br>
Understand how the ticketing process works with ![Peppermint.sh](https://www.peppermint.sh)
<br>
Edit the registry remotely and restart MS services that might be causing issues.
<br>
Use Remote Desktop Protocol to interact with client machines.
<br>
Use Windows Sandbox to see what a script will do before using it in a production environment.
